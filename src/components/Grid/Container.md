      Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst
      episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes,

      skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Ahoy hoy?

      I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Dear Mr.
      President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three.
      P.S. I am not a crackpot. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without
      gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.
