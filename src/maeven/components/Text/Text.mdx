# Text

The Text component is a low level component to style text.

## Props

<Props of="Text" />

## Examples

### Basic

A basic usage of Text.

```js live
<Text>
  Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of
  strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one
  all-powerful Force controlling everything.
</Text>
```

### Inline

Text can be an inline (`span`) or block (`div`) element.

```js live
<Text>
  Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.{' '}
  <Text inline color="indigo">
    I've seen a lot of strange stuff
  </Text>
  , but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force
  controlling everything. <Text color="orange">
    There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
  </Text> It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
</Text>
```

### Style HTML

Text can style all native html elements with current theme style.

```js live
<Text styleHtml>
  <h1>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</h1>
  <p>
    You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and <a href="#">go home</a>!
    Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your
    side, kid. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you
    think?
  </p>
  <p>
    Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna
    explain this? I'm trying not to, kid. The more you tighten your grip,
    Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
  </p>
  <h2>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</h2>
  <p>
    Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The
    ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
    But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to
    fight?
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</li>
    <li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</li>
    <li>He is here.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in
    for it as it is.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot
    of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's
    one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy
    field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and
    nonsense. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've
    constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the
    power of the Force.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</li>
    <li>Ye-ha!</li>
    <li>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</li>
  </ul>
</Text>
```

### Color

Text can be styled in different (theme) colors.

```js live
<div style={{ columns: '2 auto' }}>
  <Text color="black">Black</Text>
  <Text color="blue">Blue</Text>
  <Text color="cyan">Cyan</Text>
  <Text color="darkGrey">DarkGrey</Text>
  <Text color="green">Green</Text>
  <Text color="grey">Grey</Text>
  <Text color="indigo">Indigo</Text>
  <Text color="orange">Orange</Text>
  <Text color="pink">Pink</Text>
  <Text color="purple">Purple</Text>
  <Text color="red">Red</Text>
  <Text color="teal">Teal</Text>
  <Text color="white">White</Text>
  <Text color="yellow">Yellow</Text>
  <Text color="primary">Primary</Text>
  <Text color="secondary">Secondary</Text>
  <Text color="success">Success</Text>
  <Text color="info">Info</Text>
  <Text color="warning">Warning</Text>
  <Text color="danger">Danger</Text>
</div>
```

### Truncate

Truncate text with ellipsis when text is longer than one line. Only works when inline is `false`.

```js live
<div style={{ width: 400 }}>
  <Text truncate>
    A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old
    master. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides,
    attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more
    likeâ€¦suicide.
  </Text>
</div>
```

## Design Guidelines

Use the `Text` Component to style text in components or on a page.

<DoDont
  do={['Use Text with styleHtml for large amounts of static text']}
  dont={[
    'Use Text when a specified component is more appropriate (e.g. Header, Link)'
  ]}
/>
