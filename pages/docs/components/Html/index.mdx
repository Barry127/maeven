# HTML

Maeven exports semantic HTML Components with theme styling.

Currently supported components: `A`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`, `H5`, `H6`, `Li`, `Ol`, `P`, `Span`, `Ul`.

## Examples

### Headings

Headings are text in a larger size than regular text.

```js live
<>
  <H1>Heading 1</H1>
  <H2>Heading 2</H2>
  <H3>Heading 3</H3>
  <H4>Heading 4</H4>
  <H5>Heading 5</H5>
  <H6>Heading 6</H6>
</>
```

### Text

Some text with paragraphs, lists and headings.

```js live
<>
  <H1>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</H1>
  <P>
    You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and <A href="#">go home</A>!
    Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your
    side, kid. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you
    think?
  </P>
  <P>
    Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna
    explain this? I'm trying not to, kid. The more you tighten your grip,
    Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
  </P>
  <H2>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</H2>
  <P>
    Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The
    ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
    But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to
    fight?
  </P>
  <Ol>
    <Li>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</Li>
    <Li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</Li>
    <Li>He is here.</Li>
  </Ol>
  <H3>
    Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in
    for it as it is.
  </H3>
  <P>
    Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot
    of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's
    one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy
    field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and
    nonsense. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've
    constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the
    power of the Force.
  </P>
  <Ul>
    <Li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</Li>
    <Li>Ye-ha!</Li>
    <Li>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</Li>
  </Ul>
</>
```

## Design Guidelines

Use HTML components to add textual content in a semantic order.

<DoDont
  do={[
    'Always use a semantic hierarchy for page content',
    'Use Text component to style a lot of text'
  ]}
  dont={['Use non-semantic components like div or span to order content']}
/>
