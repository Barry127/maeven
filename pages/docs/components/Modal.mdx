### Basic

A basic usage of Modal.

```js live withRender
const ModalComp = () => {
  [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Modal
        icon={userCircleSolid}
        title="Hello World"
        isOpen={isOpen}
        maximizable
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
        color="primary"
      >
        <P>
          Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
          The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of
          the Force. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I
          supposed to fight?
        </P>
        <Ol>
          <Li>
            You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!
          </Li>
          <Li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</Li>
          <Li>He is here.</Li>
        </Ol>
      </Modal>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open</Button>
    </>
  );
};

render(<ModalComp />);
```
